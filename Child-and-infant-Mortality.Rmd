## Child and Infant Mortality

"In this entry we are giving an overview of the mortality of infants and children. In demography, *child mortality* refers to the death of children *under the age of five* while **infant mortality** refers to the death of those **under the age of one.**" (https://ourworldindata.org/child-mortality)



```{r cars}
# Mortality rate, under-5 (per 1,000 live births)
mortality_rates <- read.csv("./DATA/child-mortality-igme.csv")
colnames(mortality_rates) <- c("Country","Code","Year","Rate")
mortality_rates %>% select(Rate) %>% diagnose_numeric() %>% flextable()
```
```{r}
average_rate <- mortality_rates %>% group_by(Year) %>%
  summarise(Mean = mean(Rate),
            Median = median(Rate))
ggplot(average_rate) + geom_line(aes(x=Year,y=Mean),lwd=1) +
  labs(title = "Mean Infant/Child Mortality Rate per Year",
       y="Mean Mortality rate (per 1,000 live births)",subtitle = "(Under Age 5)")
